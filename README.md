# Learning Journal
 
This application includes a database and an interface for a learning journal web application. The main page summarizes the journal entries, with the entry title linking to a page with the detailed journal entry and the entry tags linking to a filtered page showing only the journal entries with that tag.

The application lets authenticated users add, edit, or delete journal entries. The results for these entries are stored in a database and displayed in the blog style website.
