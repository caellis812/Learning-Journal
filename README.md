# Learning Journal
 
This application includes a database and interface for a learning journal web application. The main page summarizes the journal entries, where the title links to a page with the detailed journal entry and the tags link to a filtered page showing all journal entries with that tag.

The application lets authenticated users add, edit, or delete journal entries. The results for these entries are stored in a database and displayed in the blog style website.
